LexisNexis risk solutions, a company from Georgia founded by MeadWestvaco has teamed up with the Ventura Police Department and provided an interface for their [service call data](https://map.cityofventura.net/java/vpdcfs/).

From what is [posted at cityofventura](https://www.cityofventura.ca.gov/1052/Arrest-Log-Interactive-Crime-Map) it appears that the company is actively seeking police departments across the country to participate by allowing access to their data. Not all cities are participating, if you've typed in an address that doesn't show any data and wondered why.

At first glance you might assume these are crimes happening in real-time but these are just service calls that have been logged. No personal or detailed information is available other than the category assigned to the nature of the crime reported.

When you first access the LexisNexis map right under the address bar is an address suggestion hard-coded into the form: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC 20500".
